Homework Assignment 3
Due: Fr, Oct. 25, by 11:59p
Submit your homework on Quercus. Neat typing is required.
To type IPA symbols, consider one of the following tools:
- Online IPA keyboards, e.g.https://ipa.typeit.org/full/
- Install an IPA keyboard on your computer: (supports Windows, Mac OS, Ubuntu Linux)
https://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?item_id=UniIPAKeyboard
To draw nice trees, try out one of these tools.

1.   Consider the data below.
(1)   a. ne     kai
he
pusi
ia e
moa
PST eat

cat
thatchicken
'That cat ate the chicken.'
b. kua tomo e           ugauga
PFV drown crab
'The crab drowned.'
a.   What case alignment does this language have?
b.   In less than 5 sentences, explain how the data in (1) shows this case alignment.
c.   Aside from case alignment, make at least two non-trivial observations about the typological features of this language. (Yes, there are at least two!)
—By “non-trivial typological features,” I do have something in mind: these will need to be linguistic features that typologists have found to be “typologically interesting,” that is, features over which languages of the world display meaningful variation.
So far, our course has been dedicated to introducing those features that typologists have found to be “non-trivial” and “interesting.” So, think back to what features we have talked
about over the past weeks …
(We talked about word order, phonology, lexical categories, morphology, and now morphosyntax in simple clauses.)Research
1. Inflectional categories in the NP. Consult the descriptive grammar of your research language for the following features in the nominal domain (~in noun phrases):
Number
Case
Noun class (including “grammatical gender”)Does the morpho-syntax of your research language encode these inflectional categories? If so, what are the set of all possible values for each category? (i.e. what kind of number SYSTEM does your language have? What kind of case SYSTEM does your language have?)
2. Head-marking vs. dependent-marking of argument NP-verb relations. Review what we
learned in class about head-marking vs. dependent marking of the relation between argument NPs and verbs. Consult the descriptive grammar for your research language, and report on what type(s) of marking it displays for indicating argument NP-verb relations. Again, don’t forget to give supporting examples, in addition to a description.
Since we want to look at not just subject NP arguments, but also object NP arguments, you would need to look at transitive main clauses.
Now, look in WALS, and find a feature that is about head-marking vs. dependent marking of argument NP-verb relations.
You will NOT find this feature if you simply type “head-marking” or “dependent-marking” into the searchbox! Think about these questions, to help you find it: (i) what subsystem of language does head-marking vs. dependent-marking of argument NP-verb relations (essentially, case  subject/object agreement on the verb) have to do with? (ii) When we talk about head-marking vs. dependent-marking, we are essentially talking about where the marking is—i.e. the location of marking, or the    of marking (you will find that WALS uses a term here that is a synonym for location or place代 写LIN476H5 F 2024 Language Diversity and Language Universals Homework Assignment 3R
代做程序编程语言. Remember this term.)After finding this feature, read its description. What are the values under this feature? Which category does your research language fall under, and how common (statistically) is it,judging from WALS’s sample of languages under this feature?
3. Head-marking vs. dependent-marking of possessor NP-possessum NP relations. Similarly to
2, report on which type(s) of marking your language has for possessor-possessum relations.
Also find a feature in WALS on this. What are the values defined under this feature? Which category does your language fall under, and how common is it?
4. Noun classifiers. Does your language have a system ofobligatory noun classifiers? If so, present a description, with examples, of: the position of the noun classifiers in the NP, and its variety (i.e. roughly how many noun classifiers are there in the system).
5. Word classes/lexical categories. What content lexical categories does your research language have, as far as you can tell from the descriptive grammar?
Specifically, discuss each of the following pairs/trios of word classes which we talked about in class: in what ways are they distinct word classes in your language, or non-distinct? In your discussion, refer back to our discussion on the criteria by which linguists distinguish word classes in a language, present what you find in the descriptive grammar, give specific examples to support your findings.
6. “Whole-language morphological typology”. Report on how the morphological system of your research language is classified, under the “whole-language typology” approach.
(You should check the introductory chapter of your descriptive grammar to see if the author(s) themselves give such a “whole-language” characterization. Whether or not they do, give your own characterization, and briefly explain why—refer to the definitions of each of the “types” of languages under the “whole-language typology” approach.)
General guidelines:
Write brief, but full, responses that read like a short, summary report, with summary descriptive statements, examples, and discussions that link the examples to your statements. Don’tjust give simple “answers ” to each question.
You will want to:
Start your response with descriptive statements summarizing what your language does, or does not, have. For instance, “XXX has A and B in its inflectional morphology, but not C. ”
Find and show examples that directly support the summary descriptive statements above.
For instance, if you say that “XXX has A in its inflectional morphology, ” you need to give examples that show that XXX indeed does have A in its inflectional morphology.
Even ifyour language does NOT mark a certain feature,you should show good examples that conclusively demonstrate that this feature is NOT marked.
Unless it is absolutely obvious how the example supports your statement, give a brief discussion
that tells your reader how the examples show the point made in the statement. For instance: “In
example (N), the suffix -X is an ABC marker. This type of marker regularly appears on verbs, which means that …  towards your point>. ” 
Type your examples, formatting them in the same way that you practiced in Assignment #1. 
Finally, don’t forget to provide an in-line citation for each example cited from your sources, to show which page it is from. You practiced this in Assignment #1.
